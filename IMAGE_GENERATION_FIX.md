# Gemini Image Generation Fix Summary

## Issue Found
The `generate_image` function was failing because:
1. It was using `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` which is an older experimental model
2. The `generationConfig` with `responseModalities: ['Text', 'Image']` wasn't being passed correctly to the API

## What Changed
Based on Google's latest documentation, image generation with Gemini 2.0 Flash requires:
- Using the specific model: `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation`
- Passing `generationConfig` to the `generateContent()` method (not to `getGenerativeModel()`)

## Files Modified
1. **src/config.js**: Updated model names for IMAGE_GENERATION and IMAGE_EDITING
2. **src/gemini/gemini-service.js**: Fixed how `generationConfig` is passed in `generateImage()` and `analyzeImage()` methods

## To Apply the Fix

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** to reload the MCP server with the changes

2. **Test the fix** using the provided test script:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/rob/Claude/mcp-servers/gemini-mcp-server
   chmod +x test-image-generation.js
   ./test-image-generation.js
   ```

3. **Or test directly in Claude** by using the generate_image tool:
   ```
   Use the generate_image tool to create "A beautiful serene mountain landscape at sunset" with context "artistic"
   ```

## Important Notes
- The image generation feature is in preview and may have rate limits
- Generated images will be saved to: `~/Claude/resources/gemini-images/`
- The fix also applies to the `gemini-edit-image` tool which uses the same preview model

## API Changes
Google updated their image generation API approach:
- Old: Regular Gemini 2.0 Flash models don't generate images
- New: Must use specific preview models with `responseModalities` configuration
- Model name: `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation`

The refactored Smart Tool Intelligence system is working perfectly - the issue was just with the Gemini API configuration for image generation!
